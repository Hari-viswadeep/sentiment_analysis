review1 = "I so wanted to like this place, but left feeling sad. Not just disappointed, but sad. Remove the Maltese falcon (both the book and the bird), and what's left is a restaurant which is uncomfortable, grossly over-priced and kind of depressing. If a Maltese Falcon experience is essential to your San Francisco vacation, have a drink at the bar. For God's sake, however, do not allow yourself to be tricked into paying +$30 for chops, a baked potato and three tomato slices. This place defines \"tourist trap\""

review2 = "Two years ago virtually to the day, the Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi was a jury member at the Cannes Film Festival, his chair remaining empty throughout the proceedings because he was being held captive in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, jailed under unspecified charges. Since then he has been released, accused of making anti-state propaganda, put under house arrest and banned from making movies for 20 years. “This Is Not a Film,” which Panahi made with fellow director Mojtaba Mirtahmasb, is indeed not a film -- it’s a cry from the heart of an artist compelled to create, tell stories and respond to hostile, confounding realities. “This Is Not a Film” opens as Panahi has breakfast in the sunny, well-appointed apartment he shares with his wife, daughter and pet iguana Igi. Alternately filming on an iPhone and a digital camera, Panahi methodically records his day, bidding his family good-bye as they embark on a trip out of town, hanging around with the preternaturally catlike Igi, consulting with his lawyer about his appeal and finally calling Mirtahmasb to come over and help him film. Once his friend arrives, Panahi begins to read from the screenplay he wanted to direct before his troubles began, marking out a Brechtian theatrical space of lines on the rug, while passionately narrating the movie in his head. At one point, Panahi looks at Mirtahmasb and says, “Cut” -- an order his colleague ignores because “you’re not supposed to be directing.” Such fleeting moments of mordant meta­humor aside, “This Is Not a Film” tells an agonizing tale in miniature, as Panahi quietly, desperately tries to work out the creative issues that drive him. In the midst of his improvised non-movie, he breaks down: “If we could tell a film, why make a film?” Cinema is Panahi’s medium, as he goes on to explain while watching his 2003 film “Crimson Gold.” Only cinema coincides with Panahi’s own love of spontaneity, surprise and the felicitous mistake -- as when, later, a neighbor stops by with her dog, an interruption that eventually leads “This Is Not a Film” to its moving, surprisingly dramatic conclusion. That finale -- both explosive and heartbreakingly anti-climactic -- is accompanied by the holiday fireworks that are going off throughout “This Is Not a Film.” The fact that some viewers (and even, momentarily, Panahi himself) might mistake the pops and whistles for gunfire attests to why an otherwise left-handed project assumes such dramatic life-and-death stakes. At a time when films such as the Oscar-winning “A Separation” have introduced scores of American viewers to the vibrant world of Iranian cinema, Panahi proffers an anguished reminder that artists in that country are under a constant, psychically debilitating threat of censorship and worse. The most moving scene in “This Is Not a Film” is a tiny one, when Panahi walks to his balcony to observe the festivities below and can’t help but begin filming with his iPhone. This is an urgent, affecting self-portrait of an artist who can’t help but frame his world, and try to make sense of an oppressive and absurd system around him."

review3 = "If I had written about the meal 10 months ago here, it would've been five stars.  Alas, this meal was not so deserving.  A little background:I have a good mate from Belfast, Northern Ireland.  His parents and Auntie and Uncle came out here last year and wanted a solid \"meat and two veg\" meal.  I sent them to John's and they had a great time.   So good a time that they ate there at least twice in their 4 day trip.  That's how good it was.They come back for my friend's wedding 10 months later and where do they want to go, now with even more relatives?  You guessed it, John's Grill.  Mate calls up and asks if they can make a reservation for 13, fully realizing this is a tall order.  \"No problem!\" is the reply.  So we show up at the appointed time to find...two tables (round) near each other.  Now realize this is an extended family that has come from a total of four different countries to be together.  They want to sit at the same damn table, but not wanting to rock the boat we just push them together into a \"8\" shape.  Okay, we got past that.Move on to ordering drinks.  Waiter screws it up and it takes 30 minutes to get the drinks right.  Another 15 minutes goes by until we can flag down a waiter that is willing to take our order.  We all order quickly enough as we have been there 45 minutes already and have memorized the menu by now.Another hour rolls by.......Finally the food comes out.  My potato is hard as a rock from being under a heat lamp for god knows how long, the green beans are like smooshed worms, and my steak is cold.  When I say \"cold\" I don't mean, \"not piping hot\" I mean COLD.  As in, \"has been sitting on a counter and not under a heat lamp for over 20 minutes\".  And its not just my steak that's cold.  Its everyone's.  A total of 13 ruined meals.  We call the waiter over and his response is, \"we only have one chef tonight, sorry\".  Then he walked away.  I raised the point that they seem to have plenty of waiters, and last time I checked its the waiters that bring the food, not the cooks.  Basically the food was rendered inedible, at least when you're paying over $30 a plate.We complained again to a waiter whom called down to the front desk to the manager? owner? someone? who told us this gem: \"You have two options.  We can reheat the food, and you can pay full price, or you can leave, and we will still charge you full price.\"  Neither of these was acceptable to us.  We worked out a compromise in that we would pay for our drinks and appetizers (fine.  No argument there, we were prepared to do that all along), and we wouldn't be charged for the steaks.  No problem.  We even left a 20 tip as the waiters were actually really nice about it all.  My friend and I went down to talk to the owner/manager guy personally, but when we got down to the first floor, we were informed by a waiter that the guy had immediately hung up the phone and ran (ran!) across the street to his car and drove away before we could talk to him.Talk about cowardly behavior.  The waiters all to a man told us that that is his standard procedure when faced with a dispute.  He gets in his car and goes off and hides for an hour or so until things cool down.  Now, is that any way to run a business?"
